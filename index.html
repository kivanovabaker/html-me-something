                <p>People have always had a lot to say about immigrants. Whether hated, feared, pitied, or revered, there
                    has never been a lack of emotion in regard to strange new folks that don't quite fit. Our ancestors
                    relied on close social networks to stay alive, so perhaps it is natural to fear those who are not like
                    us. However, this same fear hinders progress, engenders hate, leads to senseless bloodshed, and
                    prevents immigrants from being seen first and foremost as simply people. The following paragraphs
                    are just one short glimpse at a growing human that flew 5,508&nbsp;miles and worked to make a new home in
                    St.&nbsp;Louis,&nbsp;MO.</p>

                    <h4>Roots</h4>
                    <p>Hello, my name is Kseniya. I like to say that I grew up in Kharkov, Ukraine. In reality, I was just
                        a few months short of 11 when we arrived in the February of 2002. Where that fits on the spectrum
                        of growing up, I'm still not sure. While I was still malleable, my core values and beliefs were
                        already formed, of rich black dirt, wheat, and potatoes - I like to think.</p>
                    <p>I had grown up a happy child, born on the first of May or International Workers' Day for much of the
                        world, very conveniently always a non-working holiday throughout the former Soviet Republics.
                        I was in love with life, had a best friend that doubled as a Siamese twin, was class president 
                        (yes, we start having those in 4th/5th grade. You also keep your class of about 30 people 
                        throughout most of your school career), and was consistently in love with someone/anyone/everyone 
                        (who knows). I was an optimistic child.</p>

                    <h4>FAQs</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Do you miss your home?</li>
                            <p>It is difficult to describe home, when you have spent large portions of your life in different
                                places. I have no home, and at the same time I have two. Do I crave the sense of community
                                I had in my childhood? Of course I do, but perhaps don't we all. Would I change my past
                                in any way? Absolutely not, I met my husband here. I learned to think differently about the
                                world here. I became myself here.</p>
                        <li>Which country is better?</li>
                            <p>It is very disappointing, but I don't have a good answer for you. There is no better or
                                worse, just different. Each of the counties that raised me has taught me valuable lessons;
                                each has given me their own special gift, filling my heart and brain with different, but
                                equally valuable ideas. I miss the closeness between people found so easily in Ukraine.
                                People are less guarded. Friendships are more cherished and occupy a greater priority in
                                life. I still keep that at my core, though I cannot say that I am as open as I once was.
                                I am forever thankful to the United States for the variety of perspectives and cultures it 
                                encompasses. A beautiful patchwork quilt that I would have never had the pleasure of viewing
                                had I stayed in Ukraine. I've hung out in groups that visually resembled the UN, with everyone
                                bringing what's best about their country into the discussion. I am inspired by America's
                                liberal ideas of tolerance, logic, and multiculturalism. The current political climate
                                might be rough, but United States of America are still a beacon of hope and progress.</p>
                        <li>What is THAT (pointing at name tag with face of astonishment and/or disgust)?</li>
                            <p>Please don't ever ever ever phrase a question of "How do you pronounce your name?" in
                                this manner. THAT is my name. Some common decency would be nice.</p>
                            <p>My name, Kseniya, comes from Greek. Xenia(Ξένια) is the ancient
                                Greek concept of hospitality, the generosity and courtesy shown to those who are far from home.
                                The world would be better with more of THAT.</p>
