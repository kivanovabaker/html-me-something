                <p>People have always had a lot to say about immigrants. Whether hated, feared, pitied, or revered, there
                    has never been a lack of emotion in regard to strange new folks that don't quite fit. Our ancestors
                    relied on close social networks to stay alive, so perhaps it is natural to fear those who are not like
                    us. However, this same fear hinders progress, engenders hate, leads to senseless bloodshed, and
                    prevents immigrants from being seen first and foremost as simply people. The following paragraphs
                    are just one short glimpse at a growing human that flew 5,508&nbsp;miles and worked to make a new home in
                    St.&nbsp;Louis,&nbsp;MO.</p>

                    <p>Hello, my name is Kseniya. I like to say that I grew up in Kharkov, Ukraine. In reality, I was just
                        a few months short of 11 when we arrived in the February of 2002. Where that fits on the spectrum
                        of growing up, I'm still not sure. While I was still malleable, my core values and beliefs were
                        already formed, of rich black dirt, wheat, and potatoes - I like to think.</p>
                    <p>I had grown up a happy child, born on the first of May or International Workers' Day for much of the
                        world, very conveniently always a non-working holiday throughout the former Soviet Republics.
                        I was in love with life, had a best friend that doubled as a siamese twin, was class president 
                        (yes, we start having those in 4th/5th grade. You also keep your class of about 30 people 
                        throughout most of your school career), and was consistently in love with someone/anyone/everyone 
                        (who knows). I was an optimistic child.</p>
